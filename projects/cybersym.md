Dan and I developed this simulation as a way to close the loop between the Cybernetics Conference Library, the speakers, and the attendees. We envisioned the loop as:

- people hear speakers and have conversations
- they visit the Library
- checkout books influenced by the speakers and their conversations
- those populate questions in the simulation (extracted from Library books)
- these questions show up on the projector during speaker Q&A's
- which compel the audience to ask certain questions
- which then feed into conversations and subsequent speakers.

Attendee badges had a QR code on them which uniquely assigned them a planet in the simulation. Their planet accumulates procedurally-generated debris based on the books they check out using their QR code.

We extracted all questions from the books we had the full text for, then curated the best questions from this pool by hand. When a book is checked out, we add the questions from that book into the pool of questions the Galaxy view displays, which is projected during Q&As.

The Library effort was led by David Hecht and Sarah Hamerman, and the Conference itself was organized by many, including Melanie Hoff, Sam Hart, Alexis Convento, Irene Alvarado, Austin Smith, Callil Capuozzo, and many volunteers and partners. The full credits are on [the Conference site](http://cybernetics.social/).
