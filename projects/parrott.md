name: Parrott
desc: First attempt at automating social media presence with a bot

Parrott was a very simple automated retweeter that tried to learn what you tended to retweet and eventually take over on your behalf. It wasn't very good but it was, as near as I can remember, my first NLP project and got me interested in the field, so it holds a special place with me.
