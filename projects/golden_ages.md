Golden Ages was a music project from 2009-2011, once featured as Stereogum’s “Band to Watch”. As Golden Ages, I released one album (_Tradition_), two EPs (_Sitting Softly in the Sea_ and _Africa_, which included a cover of Toto's song of the same name), two music videos (for the songs _Everything Will Be Alright_, which premiered on Pitchfork, and _Chinese Sun_), and remixed several artists including Surfer Blood, Blackbird Blackbird, and MillionYoung. It was fun but stressful. Live performances are hard.

> “Set like a jewel into an increasingly familiar glitz and shine of tearaway loops and found sounds, they’re a bold step back to the time when big acoustics mattered”...“that slick cosmic/starry feel that crosses over into their art and clean feelings, approached particularly linearly here with focus on making POSITIVE JAMMERS”...“a brilliant composition of sounds that swarm around your brain”...“Falling somewhere impossibly blissful between the experimental side of Animal Collective and the accessible side of Fuck Buttons”.
>
> “_Tradition_, is a miniature opus whose multiple layers create a warm and vibrant listening experience. Organic and compelling, Golden Ages succeed in transforming simple sounds into acoustic giants.” – _I Heart Comix_
>
> “...sounds like being birthed inside of a rainbow...adept at capturing full-spectrum sound” – _FADER_
>
> “...a soothing slice of spacey electronic pop powered by swirling synths, blown-out low-end, and Mr. Ages’ ghostly vocals” – _XLR8R_
>
> “They take the finer points of the original and mix in the sound of nostalgia, creating songs that bring old memories to mind, memories that are transformed into the way they always should have been.” – _yourstruly_
